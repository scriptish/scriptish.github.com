In the latest release of Greasemonkey, [my pull request for GM_setClipboard from
over 3 years ago was finally integrated](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/commit/4523f8fe3347d89272b72722273a1ed114e0f2b1#modules/GM_setClipboard.js)

I sure am glad that I decided to fork Greasemonkey and provide this to people 3 years ago in Scriptish!
